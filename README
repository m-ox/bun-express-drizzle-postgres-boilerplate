## Bun/Express/PostgreSQL Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for a simple Bun-powered Express.js API and a Dockerized postgreSQL database.

Without Typescript.

# Running the API:
You will need Docker installed. Also login on your command line.
```Docker login```

You will need an .env in this project, so configure that. Feel free to use the example though for just checking it out.

Then you're gonna slam these down in your command line:
- ```docker-compose up -d```
